        <h1>Dear Rakshikha,</h1>
        <p>
            I need you to know that for me, it was never just about romance. My feelings for you went far beyond that. From the very beginning, I’ve been deeply attached to you, not just as someone I care about, but as someone who became a part of my soul. It was never about trying to win you over or convincing you to love me back—it was about the connection we shared, the bond that meant everything to me.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have always had just one thing to lose in this—my heart. And I willingly put it on the line, knowing that my love for you was the truest thing I’ve ever felt. I never expected anything in return, except maybe the chance to show you how much you mean to me. It’s not your fault that you couldn’t feel the same way, and I don’t blame you for that. Everyone has the right to their own feelings, and I respect that more than anything.
        </p>
        <p>
            But I want you to understand that my love for you was pure and unselfish. I loved you more than anything else in this world, not because I wanted something from you, but because I found something in you that I’ve never found in anyone else. It’s hard for me to let go because I wasn’t just losing a romantic interest—I was losing a part of myself that I had tied to you.
        </p>
        <p>
            You mattered to me in ways that words can’t fully capture. It wasn’t just about the times we spent talking or the plans we made—it was about the way you made me feel seen and understood. You brought a light into my life that I hadn’t known before, a sense of connection that was both rare and precious. When I was with you, even if just in conversation, I felt like I had found someone who truly got me, someone who could look past the surface and see the real me. That’s why you mattered so much to me—because you touched a part of my soul that no one else ever has.
        </p>
        <p>
            My love for you was real because it wasn’t based on superficial things. It wasn’t about how you looked or what you did—it was about who you are at your core. I loved you for your kindness, your intelligence, your unique way of looking at the world. I loved the way you could make me smile even on the hardest days, the way you made me feel like I was someone special just by being myself. My love was real because it wasn’t conditional—it was just there, steady and unwavering, no matter what.
        </p>
        <p>
            And that’s why it hurts so much now. I didn’t just lose a chance at romance; I lost someone who I believed was meant to be a part of my life. I poured everything I had into loving you, not because I wanted anything back, but because you were worth it. You were worth every bit of love, every moment of longing, every tear I’ve shed since this all began. I saw something in you that made me believe in the power of love, in the idea that two people could truly connect on a deeper level.
        </p>
        <p>
            Five years ago, I made a decision that wasn’t fair to either of us. I walked away because I couldn’t bear the weight of my feelings for you, knowing that you might never understand or reciprocate them. It was a mistake, but it was the only way I knew to protect my heart from the pain of unrequited love. I distanced myself, not because I wanted to, but because I felt I had no other choice.
        </p>
        <p>
            This time, when I opened up to you, my greatest fear became a reality—you went away because you saw how attached I was. When I told you that I wouldn’t be able to live without you, you said that you had lived without me for five years, so it wouldn’t be hard. But for those five years, I never found peace. Not a single day went by without me thinking about you, without me praying for your presence in my life. And just when I felt like you were beginning to understand me, like we were finally connecting in a way that mattered, it was all taken away.
        </p>
        <p>
            I’ve been crying day and night for days because of what happened, and I don’t know what to do anymore. It’s not your fault, and I’m not blaming you. I’m just lost in this pain that I can’t seem to bear. I loved you because I saw something in you that made me believe in the possibility of something truly special. It was the way you spoke, the way you made me feel understood, even from miles away. It was the little moments, like the movies we talked about watching together, the late-night conversations, the way you made me feel like I mattered.
        </p>
        <p>
            I loved you because you were different—because you made me believe that love was something more than just words or gestures. It was a connection that I felt in my heart, a bond that I believed was unbreakable. And even though things didn’t work out the way I hoped, I can’t help but hold onto those feelings because they were real to me. They were everything to me.
        </p>
        <p>
            The pain I’m feeling now is overwhelming. It’s like a part of me has been ripped away, leaving me empty and broken. Knowing the places i promise to show you and the movies you promised to watch with me will never become true is something breaking me. I don’t know how to move forward, how to carry on without you in my life. I’ve lost something that I truly loved, and there’s no greater pain than that. I’m not sure how I’ll get through this, but I want you to know that you did nothing wrong, please do not take me wrong. I’m just hurting in a way that I can’t describe.
        </p>
        <p>
            Maybe I need help to get through this, but I want you to understand that it’s not your fault. I don’t blame you for anything. I just wish things could have been different. I wish I could have shown you how much you mean to me in a way that didn’t push you away. I’m sorry if I made you feel uncomfortable or if I hurt you in any way. That was never my intention.
        </p>
        <p>
            I hope that one day, you might understand just how much I cared for you, how deeply I loved you. And even though we might not be together, a part of me will always hold onto those feelings because they were real. They were everything to me.
        </p>
        <p>
            And now, as I try to pick up the pieces of my broken heart, I just want to say that I’m sorry. I’m sorry for everything on my end. I’m sorry if I made you feel like you were in the wrong. I just wanted to be there for you, even if it was just in the background. I wanted to be a part of your life in any way I could. And even though that might not be possible now, I want you to know that I’m here, whenever you need me. i just wanted to be a part of your life nothing else.
        </p>
        <p>
            I hope one day you read this message and understand that all of this wasn’t in my control. It wasn’t my fault. It was just the way I felt, and I couldn’t change that. I tried to hide it, to keep it from affecting us, but in the end, it was too much. And now, I’m left with this pain that I don’t know how to handle. But I’ll get through it, somehow. I just hope you’re doing well, and that you’re happy, because that’s all I ever wanted for you. Lastly, I am sorry , please don't get mad at me. I am not at all trying to win you over and trying to project that it's your fault. That is not my intention at all. I am sorry about bothering you but i am just expereincing an unbearable amount of pain and I tried everything but i am not able to overcome it. I have always tried worshiping you with all my heart and devotion and I am in greatest sorrow because of what happened. Please don't get angry or mad at me for saying all this. I would say this again none of this is your fault and you did nothing wrong. I just did not want to lose you and i'm in terrible pain. I find my self crying day and night because i lost the connection. sometimes i wake up in the middle of a night and start begging please do not go please don't make distance. I hope you won't get mad at me for sharing my pain because i have noone to talk about this or help me with this and i randomly find myself saying and bagging you not to go away please. Again, I am so sorry about sharing this.Please do not get mad at me
